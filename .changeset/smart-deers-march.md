`micro-stacks` has been removed from all libaries and has been replaced by `stacks.js` packages. This is to eliminate compatibility issues with `@hirosystems/clarinet-sdk` and other libraries.

Additionally, the `@clarigen/web` and `@clarigen/node` packages are effectively deprecated, as they weren't providing any functionality that isn't provided with `@clarigen/core` in combination with other libraries.
