## Installation

Clarigen is a command-line tool that you can install globally.

To install Clarigen, run:

```bash
npm install -g @clarigen/cli
```

### Clarinet dependency

At the moment, using Clarigen requires that you have a basic Clarinet project setup. This allows Clarigen to re-use common configuration (like contracts, deployments, and requirements). If you don't have this yet, the easiest way to start is to [install Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet#installation) and run:

```bash
# change "my-project" to your project's name
clarinet new my-project
# then install Clarigen:
# cd my-project
# npm install @clarigen/cli
```

### `Clarigen.toml`

Your Clarigen-specfic configuration goes in `Clarigen.toml` at the root of your project. To generate a basic configuration file, run:

```bash
clarigen init
```

In your newly-generated `Clarigen.toml` file, you can specify if (and where) to generate code.

For TypeScript types, use the `types.output` field:

```toml title="Clarigen.toml"
[types]
output = "src/clarigen-types.ts"
```

If you don't want to generate code for either environment, just comment out that section's `output` (or the section entirely).

Learn more about [configuration](./configuration.mdx)

## Generate some code!

Now you have everything you need for Clarigen to start generating type-safe boilerplate for you. In your terminal, simply run:

```bash
npx clarigen
```
