The Clarigen CLI is the interface you'll use to generate Clarigen types. The CLI is a Deno project - so you'll need Deno installed in order to install it.

To install:

```bash
npm install @clarigen/cli
```

After being installed, you can run `clarigen` in your terminal.

```bash
npx clarigen
```

## Commands

### `clarigen`

Running `clarigen` on its own will generate type files for you.

#### Watch mode

Running `clarigen --watch` will keep the process open and watch for specific file changes. When a file change is detected, your types will be re-generated. This is helpful for actively developing tests or an app.

The files watched are:

- `Clarigen.toml`
- `Clarinet.toml`
- `contracts/*.clar`

### `clarigen docs`

Generate documentation from comments in your contracts. Check out the **TODO: add link** docs for more information.

### `clarigen init`

Generate a `Clarigen.toml` file.

### `clarigen upgrade`

Update your locally installed version of the `clarigen` CLI.

Run `clarigen upgrade -l` to list available versions.

Run `clarigen upgrade --version $version` to install a specific version.

## Log levels

To change the default logging, each command accepts either `--quiet` or `--verbose` flags, which changes the default log level used.
