title: Clarigen Boot Contracts
---

Stacks has a number of built-in contracts that are automatically deployed when a Stacks node is started. These include:

- `pox-4` and other Proof-of-Transfer contracts
- `bns`
- `signers-voting` and other Nakamoto contracts

Clarigen published a `@clarigen/boot` contract that includes the types for these contracts.

## Getting started

First, install the `@clarigen/boot` package:

```bash
npm install --save @clarigen/boot
```

You can then import the mainnet or testnet versions of these contracts:

```ts
// Import both
import { mainnet, testnet } from '@clarigen/boot';

console.log(mainnet.pox4.identifier);
```
