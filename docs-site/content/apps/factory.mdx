title: Contract Factories
---

In Clarigen, a "factory" is a fancy term for combining a contract type definition (aka the "interface" or "ABI") along with a contract identifier for a given network. It's built this way because developers usually are working with their contracts on different networks, where contracts have different identifiers.

There are a few helper methods that Clarigen exposes to connect a contract definition with an identifier.

## `projectFactory`

The most powerful way to setup your contract identifiers is to use `projectFactory`, which utilizes your Clarinet [deployments](./deployments) to determine contract IDs. For complex projects, this is the best way to keep everything configured in one place. Additionally, this is especially helpful if you're using external "requirements", which have a separate deployer on mainnet.

When using `projectFactory`, you need to specify a "network", which must be one of:

- `devnet`
- `testnet`
- `mainnet`
- `simnet`

```ts showLineNumbers {7}
// Import from auto-generated types:
import { project } from './clarigen';
import { projectFactory } from '@clarigen/core';
import { networkKey } from './constants';

export function getContracts() {
  return projectFactory(project, networkKey);
}
```

## `contractFactory`

The simplest way to setup a contract is with `contractFactory`, which takes two arguments: the contract types and the identifier.

```ts {6}
// Import from auto-generated types:
import { contracts } from './clarigen.ts';
import { contractFactory } from '@clarigen/core';

const nftIdentifier = 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.nft';
export const nftContract = contractFactory(contracts.nft, nftIdentifier);
```

## `contractsFactory`

If you want to simply specify the single "deployer" for your contracts, this helper methods maps through each contract and sets the contract's ID to `${deployer}.${contract.name}`.

For example, if `deployer` is `ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM` and you have two contracts (`nft` and `marketplace`), then `contractsFactory` will set the identifiers to `ST1P...GM.nft` and `ST1P...GM.marketplace`.

```ts showLineNumbers {10}
import { contracts } from './clarigen.ts';
import { contractsFactory } from '@clarigen/core';
import { networkKey } from './constants';

const mainnetDeployer = 'SP...';
const testnetDeployer = 'ST...';

export function getContracts() {
  let deployer = networkKey === 'mainnet' ? mainnetDeployer : testnetDeployer;
  return contractsFactory(contracts, deployer);
}
```
