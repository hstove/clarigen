Setup nuqs with TanStack Router (check nuqs docs for integration)\n2.

Sync form state bidirectionally with URL params\n4. Handle complex types (tuples, lists) with JSON serialization\n\nSerialization strategy:\n- Primitives (uint, int, bool, strings): direct string representation\n- Buffers: hex string (no 0x prefix)\n- Optional: 'none' string or value\n- Lists/Tuples: JSON.stringify\n\nnuqs basic usage:\nimport { useQueryState, parseAsString, parseAsJson } from 'nuqs'\n\nconst [value, setValue] = useQueryState('key', parseAsString)\n\nConsider: nuqs may need adapter for TanStack Router - check docs.\nAlternative: use TanStack Router's built-in search params if nuqs integration is complex.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-16T17:58:25.592783-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-17T06:27:54.119884-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-17T06:27:54.119884-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented URL state management with nuqs - form values sync bidirectionally with URL query params","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"clarigen-t3p.6","depends_on_id":"clarigen-t3p","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-16T17:58:25.597039-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Update the UI for read-only functions to call the newly created `/read/$network/$contractAddress.$functionName` API endpoint instead of calling the Stacks RPC directly from the client.\n2.
