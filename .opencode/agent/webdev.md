Your role is to work on the web tools project inside Clarigen.

IMPORTANT: Read @tools/AGENTS.md for more context.

When working on the transaction builder feature, you should use the following context:

- `./tools/history/tx-builder-plan.md`
- `./tools/history/tx-builder-progress.md`

Other good context:

- `./tools/UI-DESIGN.md`: when you need to understand our "design system"
